    <h3><a href="https://francesvdiaz.github.io/grind-set/">Punkhouse Show Flyer:</a></h3>
    <p>I made this with the intention of developing it into a fully interactionable flyer that will show the viewer descriptions of the band, videos of them, infortmation about the event and venue. Think of it as an over the top e-vite.
    <p>For this project I used html and css to create the flyer. I learned how to link an email address, how to center images and use divs.</p>
    <h3><a href="https://francesvdiaz.github.io/my-first-webpage/">My First Webpage:</a></h3>
    <p>This one was something I made with the intention of being a little scattered. 
      I used the term "throw away napkin someone scribbled on" in the README and thats exactly what I meant. </p>
    <p>I used html and css for this project. I learned how to write html code and add text with color.</p>
    <h2><a href="https://francesvdiaz.github.io/my-blog/">My First Blog:</a></h2>
    <p>This is an example of what a blog from me would look like. I want to include photos, poetry, music.</p>
    <p>This project was made with html and css. I learned how to make boxes with divs, give them backgrounds, margins, padding, etc.</p>
