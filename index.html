    <h3>Punkhouse show flyer e-vite:</h3>
    <p>I made this with the intention of developing it into a fully interactionable flyer that will show the viewer descriptions of the band, videos of them, infortmation about the event and venue. Think of it as an over the top e-vite.</p>
    <h3>My First Webpage:</h3>
    <p>This one was something I made with the intention of being a little scattered. I used the term "throw away napkin someone scribbled on" in the README and thats exactly what I meant. I want to make more throwaway blogs like this, I think of it as internet graffiti/litter which I think is dope.</p>

    <h3>About the Author:</h3>
    <p>Frances Ojeda-Diaz was born in Walla Walla, Washington. They graduated from Lincoln Alternative Highschool in 2020 and graduated from the Walla Walla Community college in 2022.</p>
    <p>Right now they are living in Portland, Oregon where they are attending Epicodus while working at Sephora on the side.</p>
    <p>Some of the things Frances enjoys are:
     <ul>       
     <li>literature</li>
     <li>cooking</li>
     <li>dreaming</li>
     <li>acting a fool</li>
      </ul>
      <p>They enjoy creating in the form of tattooing, writing, drawing, textiles and coding, and hope to find a way to bridge all mediums in the future.</p>
    <p>Frances joined Epicodus because a career as a developer seemed like a great way to ground and balance out the other parts of their life. The idea of being able to develope software that helps them express their creativity and grow is a huge plus too.</p>
    <p>They hope to see themselves as a remote developer at a small company in the future, creating software with other creatives while living in a small town near the mountains. Maybe even teaching others how to code as well.</p>
