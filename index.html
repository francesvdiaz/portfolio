    <h2>My Projects: What I've Been Working on at Epicodus</h2>
    <h3>Punkhouse show flyer e-vite</h3>
    <p>I made this with the intention of developing it into a fully interactionable flyer that will show the viewer descriptions of the band, videos of them, infortmation about the event and venue. Think of it as an over the top e-vite.</p>
    <h3>My First Webpage</h3>
    <p>This one was something I made with the intention of being a little scattered. I used the term "throw away napkin someone scribbled on" in the README and thats exactly what I meant. I want to make more throwaway blogs like this, I think of it as internet graffiti/litter which I think is dope.</p>

    <h3>About the Author:</h3>
    <p>Frances Ojeda-Diaz was born in Walla Walla, Washington. They graduated from Lincoln Alternative Highschool in 2020 and graduated from the Walla Walla Community college in 2022.</p>
    <p>Right now they are living in Portland, Oregon where they are attending Epicodus while working at Sephora on the side.</p>
    <p>Some of the things Frances enjoys are literature, cooking, dreaming and acting afool. They enjoy creating in the form of tattooing, writing, drawing, textiles and coding, and hope to find a way to bridge all mediums in the future.</p>
    <p>Frances joined Epicodus because a career as a developer seemed like a great way to ground and balance out the other creative part of their life. The idea of being able to develope software that helps them express their creativity and grow is a huge plus too.</p>
    <p>They hope to see themselves as a remote developer at a small company in the future, creating software with other creatives while living in a small town near the mountains. Maybe even teaching others how to code as well.</p>
